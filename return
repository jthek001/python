def square(x):
	return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for number in numbers:
	print(square(number))
  
# There's a lot going on there. First, in the definition of the function, x is placed in the parenthesis. 
This is called a parameter. Parameters are function specific variables. Notice how x is being used in the function without being explicitly
defined elsewhere. 

# Then, there is the keyword return. It specifies what the function should give out when it's done. Because of that, 
it also immediately ends the function. The next bit might seem somewhat abstract. 
The value of the function itself is the same as what the return statement is. 
So, in the example, print() returns the value of of x ** 2 when given square(number) because the value of square(number) is equal to 
its return statement.
